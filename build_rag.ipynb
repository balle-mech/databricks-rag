         "ない機材で歩く動作を撮影\n図3.1 姿勢推定モデルで動画（左）から抽出した関節点群\nまた、2.2(2)で述べた PoseC3D の骨格データの信頼性を本研究でのデータを使って可視\n化した。図 3.1(a)〜(b)の右の図は、信頼性が高い関節ほど明るい色の点がプロットされ\nるようになっている。図 3.1(c)は夜間の撮影でも明るくなる機材での撮影であったため人\nを認知しやすい動画になっている。抽出した骨格データも明るい色で点がプロットされて\nいて、データとしての信頼度が高いという抽出結果になった。一方で図 3.1(d)は、撮影場\n所は同じだが、通常の機材での撮影で、人が見ても人を認知しづらい動画になっている。\nそのため、プロットされている点の位置は骨格に沿っていない。点の色は暗く、データと\nしての信頼度が低いという結果になった。これにより、信頼性の低い関節の情報を弱めて\nモデルが不安定な予測を行うことを防ぐことが期待できる。\n3.2 学習曲線での評価\nデータ数に対する精度の推移を確認するために、トレーニングデータ数30個（1カテゴ\nリ10個）と60個（１カテゴリ20個）と90個（1カテゴリ30個）に分けてトレーニング\nを行った。検証データはそれぞれ12個ずつ（1カテゴリ4個）用意した。\n図3.2のグラフに、データ数ごとの学習正答率と誤差率の推移を示す。縦軸が正答率お\nよび誤差率、横軸がエポック数（データ一通り学習を繰り返した回数）である。青線はト\nレーニングデータに対する正答率、橙線は検証データに対する正答率を表しており、青の\n9点線は誤差率の推移を示す。\n(a) データ30個（1カテゴリ10個）\n(b) データ60個（1カテゴリ20個）\n(c) データ90個（1カテゴリ30個）\n図3.2 データ個数別学習曲線\n10トレーニングデータ30個の場合、初期のエポックでトレーニングおよびバリデーショ\nンデータの正答率が急速に向上している。しかし、エポックが進むにつれて、トレーニン\nグデータへの正答率はほとんど1.0だが、検証データ正答率は0.6に収まった。トレーニ\nングデータの損失も同じように急速に減少している。この挙動は、過学習が発生している\n可能性を示唆している。トレーニングデータに過剰に適合してしまい、未知のデータに対\nする性能が低下している。\nトレーニングデータ60",
